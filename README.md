# Evaluation assignment
You will receive Graphql API with a Figma file for app design. API has methods like fetchLeads() (list of all leads), fetchLead() (single lead), updateLead(), etc. Your objective is to use the Apollo Client library and create an app that displays the list of leads. Lead is a potential client, you can choose any lead from the list and open a detailed lead page. You can use either fragments with viewbindings or fully composable screens using Jetpack Compose. 
You must follow the design and implement all required pages
All pages should update in real-time after any changes inside the lead after updateLead(). hint: use Apollo cache and watch query.
In case you choose Jetpack Compose, Previews for composables are required
Optional but encouraged:
4. Implement a Lead creation page with validation on the required fields
5. Cover the project with Tests
